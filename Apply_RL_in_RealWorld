                                   Controlling Stearing of Self-Driving vehicle
 There are two approach of doing that:
 1. By Using Imitation Learning:For each State (Deflection from predicted path i.e. angle) take the correct action and by using imitation learning
                                train the NN to predict correct correct action for somewhat different state or somewhat similar state.

 2. By Using Reinforcement Learning: For each state (Deflection from predicted path i.e. angle) we can calculate reward (by using reward function)
                                     and train the NN by using State of art RL Algorithm by just using reward function to give better action.
                                     For this we need very robust reward function.

                                     From step function take Random Frame. Or may be last Frame.I need to think about how 4 Frames are taken.

# Two Problems
1. Data/Sample Efficiency : Distributional RL(C51)
2. Exploration : Do Noise to action or Do Noise Parameter.
